    <h1>Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming</h1>
    Normally,a great code has three common features:<b>maintainability;dependibility;and usability</b>.It should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even in changin environments.
     Just like with any other activity,the world of coding is also ruled by informal rules.

     <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
     <strong>This is really the most important step of all.In absence of these, a code may be inefiecient even if it is completed.</strong>
      
    
        <h3>COMMENTING</h3>
     Commentinng is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers,especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers.
     <i><u>Comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer.</u>uName of the module ,purpose of the module,description of the module,original author,modifications and <del>and authors who modified code with a description on why it was modified were components of an early commenting practice</del></i>
     <h3>GOD NAMING CONVENTTIONS</h3>
     <i>Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding.Often developers use Y<sub>1</sub> or X<sub>1</sub>as variables,and then do not replace them with meaningful names. </i>
     <h3>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3>
     <h3>PORTABILITY</h3>
     <i>Another feature of a good code is <u>portabiliy</u></i>
     <i>To achieve a certain result,developers may use complex logic but this should be <b>minimised</b>while writing a good code.An added advantage is if the code is also suitably <sup>complex</sup>.</i>
     <h4>TESTING</h4>
    <del>Testing</del> is also a necessary part in the process of coding.
    <h4>DEBUGGING THE CODE</h4>
    <i>While writing a code,it is necessary to check for errors throughout.</i>
